# Device_for_monitoring_a_premature_baby

The essence of the device is to help in monitoring the condition of the child, without causing him great discomfort. The main part of the device is hidden in the pillow on which the child’s shoulders lie. In the center is the neck color sensor - to prevent the initial hypoxia of the child (changing the color of the neck from pink to blue) and to remove the false alarm on the oximeter. Under the left shoulder is the temperature sensor of the child’s skin, to monitor fluctuations in skin temperature. Under the right shoulder - the sensor of blood oxygen saturation-pulse sensor.

The device uses sensors MAX 30100 and a color sensor - ADPS 9960, an Arduino board - mega 2560, a 10 kΩ thermistor and a bright LED - to illuminate the skin for better color sensor response.

Sensors are connected via a logic level converter from 3.3V to 5V
